## Assignment :  Convert the provided Figma design into HTML**

**Objective**:

The goal of this task is to convert the provided Figma design into a **pixel-perfect** HTML layout using **Next.js**. The task focuses on creating a web page that mirrors the design with utmost precision, paying close attention to details such as spacing, typography, and layout. You are encouraged to use either **custom CSS** or **Tailwind CSS** for styling and organize the codebase into Next.js components where necessary for better modularity and reusability.
**Requirements:**

1. **Next.js Environment**:
   1. Set up a Next.js environment to handle the project efficiently.
   1. Ensure that your project structure follows Next.js conventions, including the pages and components directories.
1. **Pixel-Perfect Conversion**:
   1. The final web page should be visually identical to the Figma design.
   1. Pay close attention to margins, paddings, colors, and font sizes as specified in the design.
1. **CSS Framework**:
   1. You can write  use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
   1. Make sure to adhere to best practices where necessary.
1. **Components**:
   1. If the design includes repeating sections, turn them into reusable **Next.js components** to follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
   1. Organize components logically, such as creating header, footer, and content section components.
1. **Responsive Design (Optional)**:
   1. Ensure the web page is fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes without compromising the design quality.
1. **Functionality**:
   1. Add any required interactive elements as per the Figma design (e.g., buttons, links, etc.).
   1. Use the Next.js routing system to navigate between pages if multiple pages are provided.

**Tools & Technologies**:

- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS or Custom CSS**
- **Figma** for design reference

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- **Accuracy**: How closely the HTML and CSS match the Figma design.
- **Responsiveness (Optional)**: The layout's adaptability to different screen sizes.
- **Code Organization**: Use of Next.js components for reusability and maintainability.
- **CSS Efficiency**: Whether you chose Tailwind CSS or custom CSS, the code should be clean, well-structured, and efficient.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
